## Running the scripts
First thing you want to do is access your source for your data. In the case of my black box it is, https://boonelab.ccbr.utoronto.ca/supplement/costanzo2009/. You want to go there to download the largest file "sgadata_costanzo2009_rawdata_101120.txt.gz". From here we will go into our preprocessing of the data with: 
#### SGA_raw_data_ingest.R

This will provide you with the proper input files for the black box. Also note during this process you need the location of the filtered allele_list. It's called 20231219_final_gene_list.txt in this procedure.
