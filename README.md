## Running the scripts
First thing you want to do is access your source for your data. In the case of my black box it is, https://boonelab.ccbr.utoronto.ca/supplement/costanzo2009/. You want to go there to download the largest file "sgadata_costanzo2009_rawdata_101120.txt.gz". From here we will go into our preprocessing of the data with SGA_raw_data_ingest.R
